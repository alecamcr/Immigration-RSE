Chosen table: 12711-0008 Wanderungen zwischen Deutschland und dem Ausland: Deutschland, Jahre, Nationalität, Herkunfts-/Zielländer
 
Decision: I find this dataset interesting because Germany is a country with a high number of migrants, and it should be an important element when considering public policies. I would like to see the distribution of the migration and characteristics of migrants (like age, country, language, sex) to find out if public policies around migration consider these data. Do public policies exist at all?
 
-       Data reported per year
 
Possible questions:
 
-       Country from the most migrants to Germany (Languages)
-       Movement between Bundesländer
-       Age and sex of the most migrants and concentration in which Bundesland?
 
Side question:
 
-       (Language) Policies in Bundesländer
-       Access to education and special education
-        Inclusion to society discriminating sex/age (both)
